# Remill.NET
This repo includes full .NET bindings for Remill. 

This code was extracted from a larger project(one with a very complicated build system), so it will not compile. It's meant to serve as a reference for other folks using .NET + LLVM + Remill for binary analysis. 

# Dependencies 
- LLVMSharp
- ICED
